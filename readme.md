# p-whilst [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/p-whilst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/p-whilst)

> While a condition returns true, calls a function repeatedly, and then resolves the promise

Think async version of the [`while` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while).


## Install

```
$ npm install p-whilst
```


## Usage

```js
const pWhilst = require('p-whilst');

let count = 0;

pWhilst(() => {
	return count < 5;
}, () => {
	count++;
}).then(() => {
	console.log(count);
	//=> 5
});
```


## API

### pWhilst(condition, action)

While `condition` returns `true`, executes `action` repeatedly, and then resolves the promise. Rejects if `action` returns a promise that rejects or if an error is thrown anywhere.

#### condition

Type: `Function`<br>
Arguments: Whatever the `action` function returns

Expected to return a boolean of whether to execute `action`.

#### action

Type: `Function`

Action to run for each iteration.

You can return a promise and it will be handled.
